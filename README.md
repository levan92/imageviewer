# ImageViewer

Works well for viewing large number of images in a folder (always hangs when doing that using GNOME Files).

## Usage

`python3 run.py <path to directory>`

- Use trackbar to move across images
- `f` or `right arrow` to move forward by 1 image
- `d` or `left arrow` to move back by 1 image
- `g` to move forward by 10% of total number of images
- `s` to move back by 10% of total number of images
- `enter` or `spacebar` to print out filename onto terminal output
- `q` or `esc` to quit
